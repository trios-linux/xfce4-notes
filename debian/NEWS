xfce4-notes-plugin (1.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Notes for 1.4 plugin  are now stored in .config/xfce4/panel/notes.rc instead
  of .config/xfce4/panel/xfce4-notes-plugin-*.rc so at startup they won't be
  displayed. You can recover them as they are not deleted when the new version
  starts.  .  More information can be found at
  http://foo-projects.org/pipermail/goodies-dev/2006-November/000392.html

  For 1.6 plugin, upstream author says:
  - your old notes will not work
  - your old configuration will not work either

  Migrate your old data:
  WINDOW_NAME="Notes (migrate)" && mkdir -p
  ~/.local/share/notes/$WINDOW_NAME && grep '^note[0-9]*='
  ~/.config/xfce4/panel/notes.rc | cut -d= -f2- | split -l 1 -d -
  ~/.local/share/notes/$WINDOW_NAME/ && for notes in
  ~/.local/share/notes/$WINDOW_NAME/* ; do echo -e $(cat $notes) > $notes
  ; done
